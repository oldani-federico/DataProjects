### Little personal project here:

##### I send myself a text on Whatsapp every time I get gas to record current car milage (important to keep track when driving a lease), gallons of gas entered in the car and how much money was spent.
##### After that, I am able to export the chat to my cloud and clean it by using R to create a clean data table to keep track of my gas consumption and costs.
